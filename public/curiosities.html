<h3>What is being talked about:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The Milky Way is moving at more than 2 million kilometers every hour (about 600 kilometers every second) in the 
        direction of the constellation Leo. In the time it takes to read this sentence, about 5 seconds, and if you are 
        in mainland Spain or the Balearic Islands, you have moved approximately a kilometer and a half.</li>
    <li>Black holes are among the most mysterious cosmic objects, much studied but not fully understood. These objects aren’t 
        really holes. They’re huge concentrations of matter packed into very tiny spaces. A black hole is so dense that gravity 
        just beneath its surface, the event horizon, is strong enough that nothing – not even light – can escape. 
        The event horizon isn’t a surface like Earth’s or even the Sun’s. It’s a boundary that contains all the matter 
        that makes up the black hole. </li>
    <li>In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by 
        one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with
        each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, 
        charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In string theory, one of the many 
        vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries the gravitational 
        force. Thus, string theory is a theory of quantum gravity. </li>
</ul>
