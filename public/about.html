<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a woman of a certain age who has discovered that she is passionate about coding, creating and setting up web pages, 
  making small plugins for WordPress and small APIs to resolve doubts and other various curiosities. </p>

<p>On my website you will be able to see all that. I like various topics, I am interested in news that has to do with healthy 
  cooking, staying in shape, interesting things that happen in the world, curiosities about science and astronomy in general 
  because I want to know where this crazy world is going.</p>

<p>And what I want is to contribute something that helps curious minds like mine, to know a little more and be up to date on 
  all those topics mentioned.</p>
